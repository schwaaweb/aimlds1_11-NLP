    "In this assignment, you will work with a data set that contains restaurant reviews. You will use a Naive Bayes model to classify the reviews (positive or negative) based on the words in the review.  The main objective of this assignment is gauge the performance of a Naive Bayes model by using a confusion matrix; however in order to ascertain the efficiacy of the model, you will have to first train the Naive Bayes model with a portion (i.e. 70%) of the underlying data set and then test it against the remainder of the data set . Before you can train the model, you will have to go through a sequence of steps to get the data ready for training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps you may need to perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) **Read in the list of restaurant reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** Convert the reviews into a list of tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) **You will most likely have to eliminate stop words\n",
    "\n",
    "**4)** You may have to utilize stemming or lemmatization to determine the base form of the words\n",
    "\n",
    "**5) **You will have to vectorize the data (i.e. construct a document term/word matix) wherein select words from the reviews will constitute the columns of the matrix and the individual reviews will be part of the rows of the matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "**6) ** Create 'Train' and 'Test' data sets (i.e. 70% of the underlying data set will constitute the training set and 30% of the underlying data set will constitute the test set)\n",
    "\n",
    "**7)** Train a Naive Bayes model on the Train data set and test it against the test data set\n",
    "\n",
    "**8) **Construct a confusion matirx to gauge the performance of the model\n",
