When a body of text has an objective perspective, it usually reflects real factual statements with no emotion or feelings associated with it. In contrast, subjective text includes opinions encompassing emotions and feelings that are expressed by humans. Given the proliferation of social media channels, Sentiment Analysis is increasingly being leveraged by a host of entities (be it a business, a public sector organization, government, etc.) to extract the subjective and opinion related information like emotions, attitude, mood and use the extracted subjective information to the detect the sentiment of people."
