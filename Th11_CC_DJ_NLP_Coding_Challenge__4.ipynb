        "\n",
        "**2)** Create a graph of polarity to determine whether the trend over time is a positive one or a negative one. *Hint*: you will have to define a StreamListener instance to continuously listen in on a specific topic and then graph the polarity to showcase the trend (i.e. positive or negative)\n",
